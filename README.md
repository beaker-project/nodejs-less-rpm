[![Copr build status](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/beaker-project/nodejs-less/package/nodejs-less/status_image/last_build.png)](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/beaker-project/nodejs-less/package/nodejs-less/)

This repository contains the NodeJS-Less package used by Beaker Server. To ensure compatibility and functionality with Beaker Server, we've chosen a specific version (1.7.0) and included all necessary patches through backporting.

**Note:** It is strongly discouraged to use this package independently unless you are running Beaker Server. It is specifically tailored and optimized for the needs of Beaker Server.
